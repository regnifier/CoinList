# A test application for checking cryptocurrency prices

In this project you will find :
* Clean architecture
* Mvi approach for presentation layer
* **[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)** for dependency injection approach
* **[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)** for networking
* **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** for asynchronous operations
* **[Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)** for observer pattern implementation
* **[Mvi-orbit](https://github.com/orbit-mvi/orbit-mvi)** for presentation layer architecture
* **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)** for app ui

## What is it not?

* A tests. did not have enough time for implementing it.
* Correct names of git commits. In real project commits like these are not allowed. 
* A multi modules approach. I think it's overkill for the test app.
* Different git branchs. In real project of course you need to use different branches.
